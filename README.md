# Choropleth Map Data Visualization
This is a choropleth map that visualizes educational attainment data for different counties in the United States. 

## Objective

This project was part of the freeCodeCamp certification on data visualization where JSON datasets were used to retrieve data and visualize it on a choropleth map.

To complete this project, you will need the following datasets:

- **US Education Data:** [for_user_education.json](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/for_user_education.json)
- **US County Data:** [counties.json](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/counties.json)

## Getting Started
